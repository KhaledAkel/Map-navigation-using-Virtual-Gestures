# Map Navigation using Virtual Gestures

## Introduction
This project enables users to navigate through digital maps (like Google Maps) using virtual hand gestures. Leveraging a webcam, the application detects specific hand movements to perform map navigation actions such as dragging and zooming in/out.

## Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed on your system before running this script. This code has been tested with Python 3.8+.

## Installation
To run this application, you'll need to install several Python libraries including OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and NumPy. You can install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install mediapipe
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install numpy
```
